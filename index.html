                    I'm an undergraduate student from Richmond Hill, Canada and I'm currently in my 
                    first year of Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
                    From my childhood devotion to reading fantasy novels, to my love for music, to my passion for
                    crocheting, I've always had a thing for creativity. As an aspiring software engineer I hope to pair my creativity 
                    with my passion for graphic design and web development.
